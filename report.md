## Introduction

Evaluation of  products related to combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To do this it could concentrate on such areas as the drug development pipelines, latest clinical trials, form of antibiotics, and major pathogens that these new therapies are directing towards. It also might consider the state of innovation of AMR related technologies and products, barriers to the development and launch of new products and solutions, as well as mechanisms of resistance to the new products and their differential distribution across the regions

## Observation

From our analysis and summarize the given data( [here](https://vigorous-dahlia-f5d.notion.site/AMR-New-Products-Deep-Analysis-38b6b444f6224a15a3afd647f7e6c18f) you can find this deep analysis )  
and after comparing between each product category and R.D.Phase.It turns out that the use of unconventional(Non-traditional) products is highly effective, up to 96%, and that taking medications intravenously is always effective.You can see this Infographic(press [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnLhcd_LJfnsJomjtbc3gQtF7GAVvwgg/view?usp=sharing))

## .Discussion

One trend in the data is the shift towards using non-traditional methods of antibacterial therapy. These are some of the novelties that create prospects to traditional antibiotics: bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect and destroy bacteria. Bacteriophage therapy has attracted interest as it is effective in eradicating resistant bacteria without deteriorating the balance of healthy microbiota. A few products in the dataset belong to the “non-traditional” type of products, which emphasizes the focus on new ways of fighting resistant infections.  
The administration of these therapies can be via oral, intravenous or even local administration depending with the nature of the drugs and the needs of the patients. The common ways of administering it are orally and intravenous (IV) infusions. Oral administration is the most popular because it is easy, and the process does not harm the body in any way. He noted that it enables patient to take tablets without necessarily making frequent trips to hospitals or machining equipment. However, in the case of severe infections, mainly caused by MDR pathogens, IV administration is considered more appropriate. IV therapy makes it possible to deliver the drugs straight into the patient’s bloodstream, where they start working almost instantly; a factor of paramount importance in life threatening conditions.  
Another feature worthy of note is the specificity of the pathogens that are highlighted by the dataset. Products are currently being developed for an array of pathogens, with many targeting what the world health organization (who) has categorized as ‘priority pathogens’. Some of these diseases are tuberculosis and clostridium difficile that have displayed high levels of resistance to the drugs used in their treatment. It is evident that new therapies against these organisms is a key in combating the looming AMR crisis across the globe.

## Conclusion

The information about AMR products indicates that fighting against drug-resistant infections is possible in the future. This is especially so in considering nontraditional therapies alongside various delivery routes, all of which are in synch with AMR management. With more products transitioning from the clinical phase to the markets, there is hope that one of the biggest medical issues facing humanity might be solved.
